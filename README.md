# Management system
This is my management system that is connected to my mysql database with jdbc.
I used dao classes for the implementation.

## Description
- It manages households, persons and pets.
- Households contain multiple persons and persons can have multiple pets.
- Households can be created, updated and deleted, aswell as chosen from a list of all households to add persons.
- Persons can be created, updated and deleted, aswell as chosen from the list of the household to add pets.
- Pets can be created, updated and deleted, aswell as previewed by a list from a person.
- Every object creatd gets a uniqe id, so having the same name, age, adress, etc. is no problem.
- The management sytem can be controled with inputs in the console.
